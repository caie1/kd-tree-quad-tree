Group project Problem 1 by Emma Cai and Camilla Tan.

This project is an implementation of kd-tree and point quad tree.
The dataset we used is a subset of American cities which only include latitude and longitude.

1. Q: Which one is easier to implement?
   A: kd-tree is easier to implement. For kd-tree, we only need to check the level to proceed, while for quadtree,
      we need to check if the node is empty, a leaf node or a pointer, and based on the options, we will store node, split 
      into more nodes, or re-insert previous nodes. Thus, quadtree has more data type involving, it's more complex to implement. 
   
2. Q: Which appears to be more space efficient?
   A: kd-tree is more space efficient. kd-tree is a binary search tree where each node at most has two children, 
      while quadtree's node either has four children or itself is a leaf node. We could also have empty nodes left in quadtree.
 
3. Q: Which appears to be more time efficient.
   A: The time complexity of kd-tree is O(logn), while quadtree is O(?).
